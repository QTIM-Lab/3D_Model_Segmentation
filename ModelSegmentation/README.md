# QTIM Model Segmentation - 3D Slicer

This is a module developed for 3D Slicer by the Quantiative Tumor Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (QTIM). Its goal is to provide easy and effecient manual segmentation of regions-of-interest for medical images, particularly with high slice resolution. It does this through the automatic creation of 3D region-of-interest 'models' using ITK's Delaunay Triangulation Method, as well as subtraction mapping and editing features already present in Slicer. The model-creation method has been lifted from the previous Slicer module 'Volume crop with model' by [AUTHOR] at [LINK]. The UI and skeleton of this module has been based off Slicer's ChangeTracker module created by Andrey Fedorov at https://github.com/fedorov/ChangeTrackerPy. Was worked on as part of Winter Project Week 2017, hosted by NA-MIC [LINK].
